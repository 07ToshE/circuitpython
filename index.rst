Adafruit's MicroPython API Reference
========================================

Welcome! This is the documentation for Adafruit's version MicroPython. It is an
open source derivative of MicroPython for use on educational development boards
designed and sold by Adafruit including the Arduino Zero, Adafruit Feather M0
Basic, Adafruit Feather HUZZAH and Adafruit Feather M0 Bluefruit LE.

Adafruit's MicroPython port features a unified Python APIs available under
`shared-bindings` and a growing list of drivers that work with it. Currently
only the Atmel SAMD21 port is supported but ESP8266 support will be added in the
near future.

Adafruit has many excellent tutorials available through the Adafruit Learning
System. These docs are low-level API docs and may link out to separate getting
started guides.
